# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It was created by me, Paige Nelmes, as part of my learning with Lighthouse Labs.

This project was a great way to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as my Node and Express back-end skills. I had an absolute blast making this app! I hope you have fun trying it out, too.
